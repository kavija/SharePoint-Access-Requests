# SharePoint-Access-Requests

Sometimes administrators/support engineers need to handle the SharePoint Access Requests.

It is a repetitive task and boring.

I wanted to automate this process, so that you really do not have to spend lot of time on a request.

The idea is that you get the access request invitation link and paste it on the provided box. It should get you the request details.

you can then request the approval and grant permission as well as you can also raise a Service Request for the same.
